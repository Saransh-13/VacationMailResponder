According to me this are the main area i can work on too improve the code structure and readability. Also an optimized code will help to use the functions efficiently.
Error Handling: The code could benefit from more robust error handling and graceful error recovery. This includes handling API errors, network failures, and edge cases to ensure the application can handle unexpected scenarios without crashing or leaving the system in an inconsistent state.
Modularization: Breaking down the code into smaller, reusable functions and modules can improve code maintainability and readability. Consider modularizing different functionalities, such as authentication, email handling, and scheduling, into separate modules for better organization and easier future enhancements.
Code Separation: Currently, the code for authentication, email handling, and scheduling are combined. Separating these concerns into distinct modules or files can enhance readability and maintainability, allowing for easier understanding and modifications in the future.
Logging: Adding comprehensive logging throughout the application can assist in troubleshooting issues and monitoring the apps behavior. Logging key events, errors, and important information can provide valuable insights into the application's runtime behavior and simplify debugging.
Optimization: Depending on the scale and performance requirements of the application, there may be opportunities for optimization. This could include optimizing API calls, minimizing unnecessary data retrieval, or implementing caching mechanisms to reduce latency and improve response times.
