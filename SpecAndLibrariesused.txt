Specifications:

Language: JavaScript (Node.js)
Email Provider: Gmail
Authentication: "Login with Google" API (OAuth2)
Functionality: Check for new emails, send replies, add labels, and move emails within Gmail
Interval: Randomized intervals between 45 to 120 seconds for checking new emails

Libraries and APIs used:

Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment that allows executing JavaScript code outside of a web browser.
googleapis: A library for interacting with various Google APIs, including the Gmail API, to perform actions such as reading emails, sending emails, and managing labels.
node-schedule: A library that provides an easy-to-use interface for scheduling recurring tasks based on cron-like expressions. Used to schedule the periodic checking of new emails.
readline: A built-in Node.js module that provides an interface for reading input from a readable stream, such as the command line.
util: A built-in Node.js module that provides utility functions for various common programming tasks.
The googleapis library is used to interact with the Gmail API, allowing the app to authenticate, fetch emails, send replies, manage labels, and modify email threads.

The node-schedule library is used to schedule the periodic checking of new emails at randomized intervals between 45 to 120 seconds.

The readline module is utilized for obtaining user input, particularly when requesting the authorization code during the initial authentication process.

The util module provides utility functions, such as the promisify function, which converts callback-based functions to return Promises, making it easier to work with asynchronous operations.

These libraries and APIs enable the app to connect with Gmail, authenticate the user, perform operations on emails, and implement the required functionality.

Please note that specific versions of these libraries may vary based on the project's requirements and the latest versions available at the time of development.
